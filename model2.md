# Model 2

Following [@Hadany2002].

## The model

There are two haploid loci with alleles *a/A* and *b/B*.
The individual fitness landscape has two peaks and a valley between them, and the population occupies the lower peak [@Crow1990]:

1. The frequent type at the begining is *ab*.
1. The relative fitness of *ab* is 1
1. The single mutants *Ab* and *aB* have a lower fitness *1-s* 
1. The double mutant *AB* has a higher fitness *1+sH*

Forward and backward mutation rates in both loci are equal to $\mu$ and there is no recombination.

### Infinite population
We first consider an infinite population.
Neglecting terms of the order of $\mu^2$, we know that the frequency of each of the single mutatns is $p=\frac{\mu}{s}$. 
Neglecting terms in the order of $\mu^3$, we know that at the **mutation-selection balance** each generation a proportion of $2\frac{\mu}{s}\mu$ of the individuals are born *AB* because of a mutation in a single mutant and a proportion of $\mu^2$ of the individuals are born *AB* because of mutation in a wild type individual.
