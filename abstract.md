Stress-induced mutation, the phenomena in which cells increase their mutation rate in response to stress and maladaptation, has been observed in bacteria, yeast and cancer cells. 
However, it is not yet understood why this phenomena evolved and how it influences evolution and adaptation. 
While some suggest that increased mutation rates are simply a by-product of stress, others argue that stress-induced mutation evolved because it increased the ability of populations to adapt to environmental changes and evolve complex traits and designs. 
I will present theoretical evidence supporting the later hypothesis and discuss some of the consequences of a regulated mutation rate.
